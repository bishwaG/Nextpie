# Email configuration

Email configuration is required for sending account recovery emails. The default user `admin` can modify SMTP details from Settings page. Login to Nextpie's web interface using username `admin` and password `admin` to change SMTP configurations. Update dummy email `admin@example.com` of `admin` user at the same time.

To be able to use Gmail for sending emails, you have to create an app password. Please follow [Google's instruction](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=en) to create an app password.

> Note: Without SMTP details Nextpie cannot send password recovery emails.

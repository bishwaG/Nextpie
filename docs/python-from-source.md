# Building Python 3.9 from source
Nextpie runs on Python3.9 because of depenmdecies not available in more recent Python 3.12. You do not need a root access to a macine to build and install Python source, but you might need to install build dependencies using sudo rights.

## Instruction video

Please refer to the instruction video on how to build Python source from [Youtube](https://youtu.be/VbsuMxXdtTk).

## Update packages
It is recommended to updata system packages to their latest versions.

In Ubuntu
```bash
sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y
```
In Redhat/Fedora/Almalinux
```bash
sudo dnf -y update
```

## Install Python build dependencies.

In Ubuntu
```bash
sudo apt install build-essential zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libgdbm-dev libnss3-dev libssl-dev libreadline-dev libffi-dev pkg-config python3-virtualenv libbz2-dev libsqlite3-dev python3-setuptools python3-dev python3-wheel git wget
```
In Redhat/Fedora/Almalinux

```bash
sudo dnf -y install openssl-devel bzip2-devel libffi-devel wget python3-virtualenv wget 
sudo dnf -y groupinstall "Development Tools"
```

## Build and install
Download Python 3.9, extract, build and install.
```bash
## Download and extract the source
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.21/Python-3.9.21.tgz
tar -xvf Python-3.9.21.tgz
cd Python-3.9.21 

## Configure
## Here we are using /opt/Python-3.9.21 as an installation path. 
## Provide a path where you have read and write access.
## Note that you do not need sudo rights to build and install Python
# sudo mkdir /opt/Python-3.9.21
# sudo chown $USER:$USER /opt/Python-3.9.21
INSTALL_PATH=/opt/Python-3.9.21
./configure --enable-optimizations --enable-shared --prefix=$INSTALL_PATH

## Build and install
make
make install
```

Make Python 3.9 available to the current shell.
```bash
export PATH=$INSTALL_PATH/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$INSTALL_PATH/lib

## update pip, setuptools and wheel
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```

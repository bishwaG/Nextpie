# Nextpie

**Nextpie** is a reporting tool for **Nextflow** workflows. It processes run metadata (trace files) generated by Nextflow, stores them in a database, and enables users to perform aggregate analyses. The tool is built using **Python Flask** and uses a UI design provided by **AppSeed**.

Nextpie comes preloaded with a sample database, allowing users to [run it with Docker](docs/deploy-docker.md) without needing any initial configuration. This makes it easy to evaluate the tool without a complex setup.

If you plan to deploy Nextpie in a production environment, please make sure to [clear the database](docs/db-clear-test-data.md) and configure [SMTP settings](docs/config-email.md) via the web interface: **Settings â†’ SMTP Settings**.

> **NOTE**: Starting from version `>=0.0.2`, Nextflow pipelines require the [nf-nextpie](https://github.com/bishwaG/nf-nextpie) plugin (a client) to upload resource usage data to Nextpie. Users no longer need to modify their pipeline code to integrate with Nextpie. Data is automatically uploaded to Nextpie when the pipeline completes. The [example pipeline](docs/nextflow-workflow.md) offers more details on using the plugin.

## Requirements

Nextpie has been tested with Python `v3.9` on **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9** and **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS**. All Python packages are version-pinned in the `requirements` directory to ensure reproducibility. As long as you can set up a Python virtual environment with the specified versions, it should work on most Linux distributions.

### Minimal Requirements

- Linux operating system  
- Python == 3.9 (with virtual environment)  
- Nextflow >= 24.10.4  

### Optional Requirements

- Conda  
- Guix  
- Docker  
- Gunicorn
